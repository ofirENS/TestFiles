function LoopedPolymerByBrownianBridges(connectedBeads,N)
% create a looped polymer of N beads at the connections defined by
% connected beads pairs, using Brownian bridges. 
% the algorithm 'folds' the polymer, starting from a random configuration
% in 3D space, by folding the ends to the starting points of each loops,
% sequentially.

% sort the loops to those contianing other loops and those which doesn't
